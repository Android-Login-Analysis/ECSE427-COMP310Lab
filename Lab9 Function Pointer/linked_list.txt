Ready Queue Management: 
The linked list is used to manage the ready queue (QUEUE),
 which stores all process control blocks (PCBs) that are ready to be executed. 
 This allows the operating system to efficiently handle the scheduling and execution of processes.

Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache: 
Another linked list manages the LRU cache (LRU_CACHE), 
which is used to keep track of the least recently accessed pages in memory. 
This is crucial for implementing page replacement algorithms which ensure that the most 
infrequently used pages are swapped out of physical memory when space is needed for new pages.

Tracking All PCBs: 
A separate linked list (ALL_PCB) is maintained to keep a 
record of all PCBs present in the system. This 
list is useful for operations that need to access or 
modify attributes of any process in the system, 
such as termination procedures or system status checks.
